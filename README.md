# Godot GDNative A* Algorithm Implementation

This project is an example of implementing the A* algorithm in Godot using C++ and GDNative. The project is based on the A* algorithm implementation provided by [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder).

## Project Summary

The project is a GDNative example of the A* algorithm developed using C++ in the Godot game engine. The primary goal is to understand how to use GDNative in C++ and adapt the A* algorithm to Godot. The project is developed based on the A* algorithm implementation provided by [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder).

## How to Use

1. **Install Godot Engine**: The project is compatible with the latest version of the Godot game engine. You can download and install Godot from the [official website](https://godotengine.org/).

2. **Clone the Project**: Clone this repository to a local directory:
 ```console
   git clone https://github.com/tarikaydin16/gdnativeAstar.git
 ```
3. **Open the Godot Project**: Open the `project.godot` file in the Godot Editor and load the project.

4. **Run the Project**: Run the project by clicking the "Run" button in the Godot Editor.

5. **Testing the A* Algorithm**: The project provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and test the A* algorithm. You can set the start and end points by holding the "Shift" and "Ctrl" keys, respectively. You can change the path by clicking on the map, and obstacles can be created by clicking with the mouse.

## How to Play

1. **Setting Start and End Points**:
- Hold down the **"Shift" key** to set the starting point and click on the desired location with the mouse.
- Hold down the **"Ctrl" key** to set the ending point and click on the desired location with the mouse.

2. **Changing the Path**:
- To change the path, simply click on the map with the mouse. The path will be automatically updated to the shortest route.

3. **Creating Obstacles**:
- You can create obstacles on the map by clicking with the mouse. Obstacles affect the calculation of the shortest path by the A* algorithm.

4. **Recalculation**:
- When you change the path or add obstacles, the A* algorithm will automatically recalculate the shortest path.

5. **Running the Game**:
- Observe the changes by clicking the "Run" button in the Godot Editor.

Feel free to explore the game by following these steps and experience how the A* algorithm works!
